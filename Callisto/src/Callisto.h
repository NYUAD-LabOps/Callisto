/**The motorController struct is stored in a block pool
there are no #define elements which describe the motor
instead, all constant and variable motor information is stored in the motorController block
this organizes all motor information in a single block of protected RAM, which is globally accessible
there is a separate motorController block for each motor

The PWM frequency of a motor is calculated as freq = 2 * (targetSpeed / (60 * stepsPerMM)).
Dividing the target speed by the step size gets the frequency in pulses/min. Dividing by 60 brings
it to pulses/second. Doubling the frequency is then required because each pulse of the PWM signal
is used to trigger an interrupt which inverts the level of the STEP pin. This halves the actual signal
frequency and so it must be doubled to compensate.

Several variables of type "ioport_level_t" are used. This data type is provided by Renesas,
and is required when interacting with GPIO pins via their read and write functions.*/
